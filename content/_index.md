        I am now pursuing a Ph.D. in Systems Design Engineering with a specialization in Aeronautics at the University of Waterloo. My research is being supervised by Dr. Shi Cao, whose profile may be seen [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/profile/s34cao). My areas of research focus on pilot performance, flying safety, and cognitive modelling.
